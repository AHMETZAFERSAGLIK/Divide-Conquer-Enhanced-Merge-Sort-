# Divide-Conquer-Enhanced-Merge-Sort
Part 1
  Execution time of Merge Sort can be decreased
with a modication on merging operation. Thus, they created the Enhanced Merge Sort
algorithm. The main dierence is dividing the array into two sub-lists according to each
element's odd-even positions before the recursive sorting operation.

Part 2 
  Min-max sorting is a sorting algorithm which also works in a divide & conquer
manner.
